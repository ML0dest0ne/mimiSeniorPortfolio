        <p> For my best work I chose to write about a coral reef animation I made for a school project. This animation took me seven weeks and during that time I learned a great deal. I used Blender, a 3D computer graphics software tool to build, paint, animate, and render my product and Adobe Premier to edit the separate render videos and sound effects to create the final video. I'm am really proud of the final result </p>
        <p> Each week I focused on a different part of the project. The first week I built and texture painted three coral assets and one fish asset. During this week I learned about the mirror modifier which allows you to build symmetrical objects. I also learned about texture painting, which allows you to paint your own texture. When I first started working with these I struggled a lot, specifically with the mirror modifier. The second week, everyone in my class shared their fish and coral assets with each other. I combed through the selection of assets to choose a couple that fit my vision for the project. After I had selected my assets, I combined them all into a single coral reef scene. The following week I animated a quick introduction render for my reef. When completing this part of the project, I learned how to create underwater lighting in blender. I used three different camera angles to capture my scene, a slow zoom in, pan, and bird's eye (snorkeling) view.</p>
        <p> Finally it was time to start my animation. I created a story arc and a storyboard with 12 different shots. For each shot I noted the camera angle, shot length, any sounds I wanted included, as well as a brief description of the shot. The fifth week I started to learn how to use armatures and weight painting to rig and animate my fish. I created three fish swimming animations using these new skills. The next week I created a first draft for my animation. I used all the skills I learned to do this. I was able to create, texture, rig, and animate more fish assets at double the speed I was before. To finish my draft I created two more fish assets and a turtle asset. I rendered my animation and edited it together with sounds in Adobe Premier to get the final first draft. I shared my first draft with my classmates and got feedback that I used to create my final draft during the last week of this project.</p>
        <p> Even though this project was one of my favorite assignments this year, looking back there are some things that I would like to improve. If I could, I would spend more time editing my animation. Some of the sound effects didn't turn out quite how I wanted them to. In the beginning I struggled to learn the concepts but as time went on I slowly gained confidence and got better. I spent a lot of time on every aspect of this project and despite my struggles I am really proud of how it turned out.</p>

        <p>For my second best work I chose to write about a game that I started building for a SkillsUSA competition. For the competition I chose a partner. My partner was the game artist and I was the level designer and programmer. This project was self led; our teachers were allowed to help if we had simple questions but could not guide us. My partner and I had full creative control of what we wanted our game to be. This game took eight long and drawn out weeks. I am very competitive so I found myself pouring all of my time and energy into this competition. Throughout the process, I used Unreal Engine 5, a 3D computer graphics game engine to build the world and program elements into it; Blender, a 3D modeling computer graphics software to animate an intro sequence; and Adobe Audition and Premiere to edit sound effects for the game and intro sequence.</p>

        <p>The very first thing my partner and I started with was our roles in the group. We assessed each of our strengths and weaknesses to find who would be better suited for what. We found that my partner was better at 3D modeling in Blender and I was better at level designing and programming in Unreal. Next we brainstormed what we wanted our game to be. After a while of talking and researching we landed on a sci-fi adventure puzzle game. In our game you are a space pilot and crash land on an alien planet. Your ship is damaged but not beyond repair. Your artificial assistant notifies you of materials nearby that can be used to fix your ship. After exploring the strange planet, you come across a path leading to an abandoned temple. Inside is a table with different rune tablets arranged on it. After solving a puzzle using the runes, a mysterious tune plays aloud resonating around the temple. Originally my partner and I ambitiously wanted to add alien creatures to the environment, more puzzles throughout the game, and a melee and compass system, however, we quickly ran out of time.</p> 

        <p>Before starting the project we made a time management plan for the following weeks. We knew how much time we had to finish the game so we built our plan accordingly. During the first week of production my partner built plant assets in Blender and I created a basic layout of the world in Unreal. Once my partner finished the plant assets I incorporated them into the landscape and began working on the day-night cycle while my partner began working on various models needed for the game. I used blueprints in Unreal to code the day and night cycle. I was completely new to Unreal blueprints and was eager to begin using them. I then began working on a sprint and stamina system as well as a narration system for the artificial assistant still using blueprints. Most of my time on this project was spent in the blueprints. I was able to code everything in the game using blueprints. After I finished programming the narration system, we had our first play test. We received valuable feedback from the playtest that allowed us to make necessary revisions. Such revisions included expanding the map, creating a path for the player to follow, adding foliage culling to reduce lag, and adding fallen trees and fire to the crash site. After incorporating the feedback from the playtest, I began working on the puzzle. The puzzle code took me almost three weeks just by itself. I struggled with almost every aspect of programming it. I tried to work through it by myself, but I became stuck on a specific problem. I couldn't figure out how to allow the blueprints for each rune to interact with each other, allowing the puzzle to end when completed correctly. I wasted time researching and watching tutorials that yielded no help. Finally, during the last week of production, I asked my teacher if he knew what to do. I had been trying to avoid asking my teacher for help, believing it would be better if I figured it out myself. My teacher quickly found the solution and showed me what to do. I was able to finish the puzzle just in time for the competition.</p>

        <p>This was my favorite project this year. I loved learning about game design and teaching myself how to build a game from scratch. If I could go back and change something, I would have asked my teacher for help sooner. I wasted so much time trying to figure it out by myself and still failing. If I had asked for help sooner I would have been able to add more into the game. Despite that, I am proud and impressed with what I created.</p>
